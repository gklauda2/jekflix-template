I'm a professional fullstack developer from Berlin. Starting with the traditional LAMP stack, I moved towards SPA development with VueJS and npm/yarn in recent years. But I'm also very much fluent in the advanced possibilites of SQL (recursive CTE, Window Functions), which I used in developing efficient marketplace algorithms for e-commerce platforms. My latest projects included:

* 2021-22: **Development of an API-driven rental software commissioned by a Swiss bike company**\
  (Vue 3 Composition API, Quasar Framework)
* 2020-21: **Development of a page builder as design tool for webshop operators**\
  (Single Page Application wie npm, Vue 2, Quasar and TipTap)
* 2018-20: **Collaborative development of a marketplace with local first algorithm for merchants and brand manufacturers**\
  (Advanced SQL, PHP, VueJS Direct Script include)
