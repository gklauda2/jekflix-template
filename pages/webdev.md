I'm a self-trained full stack/VueJS developer residing in Berlin with years of professional experience. Starting with the traditional LAMP stack and excelling in advanced SQL algorithms, I gradually moved to SPA development. In recent years I chiefly coded in JavaScript, utilizing the reactive Vue framework, and really love to carry on in that direction. My latest projects include:

* **Collaborative development of an API-driven rental software commissioned by a Swiss bike company**\
  (Vue 3 Composition API, Quasar Framework)
* **Development of a page builder as design tool for web shop operators**\
  (Single Page Application with npm, Vue 2, Quasar and TipTap)
* **Collaborative development of a marketplace with local first algorithm for merchants and brand manufacturers**\
  (Advanced SQL, PHP, VueJS Direct Script include)
